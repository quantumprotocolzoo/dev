# Device Independent Quantum Key Distribution
The code in this directory provides an implementation of the DIQKD
protocol (excluding error correction and privacy amplification) as
described in the [Quantum Protocol
Zoo](https://wiki.veriqloud.fr/index.php?title=Device-Independent_Quantum_Key_Distribution),
using Netsquid. 

The steps of 'Distribution and measurement' and 'Parameter estimation'
are implemented. At the end of the protocol, both Alice and Bob agree
upon a secure key or agree to abort.

# Requirements
- 2 Nodes capable of single-qubit measurements in upto 3 bases (2 for Alice, 3 for Bob)
- A source generating EPR pairs
- Quantum channels from the source to each node
- Authenticated public classical channel between Alice and Bob

# Changing protocol parameters
Protocol and simulation parameters are defined in utils.py and can be modified as desired

# Running
`python diqkd.py`
- Requirement: Installation of the [NetSquid package](https://netsquid.org/)
- Running: The code can be run by executing diqkd.py
- Expected output: 
    - Parameter estimation
        - Observed CHSH wins
        - Threshold CHSH wins
        - Success / Failure messages
    - Length of key distributed
    - Number of protocol rounds
